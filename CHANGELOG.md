### Fixed

#### Smart Contract
- Prevent double initialization of escrow contract (re-initialization guard) (#1)
- Prevent double initialization of oracle contract (#2)
- Use `try_transfer` for refunds instead of `transfer` to surface errors cleanly
- Verify token transfer in `deposit` before updating state
- Remove duplicate `Display` impls conflicting with `#[contracterror]` macro (E0428)
- Remove broken intra-doc link to non-existent `Error::InvalidToken`
- Resolve compile errors in escrow `lib.rs`
- Resolve Clippy errors, redundant clones, and dead code
- Resolve rustfmt failures (trailing whitespace)
- Resolve test assertion bugs in e2e tests
- Resolve infrastructure compile errors and test mismatches (#118)
- Fix CI/CD branch triggers from `main`/`develop` to `master` (#117)

#### Frontend
- Wire `handleClaim` and `handleBurn` to actual Stellar SDK transaction submission
- Wire `disconnect`, `refreshBalance`, `balance`, and `wrongNetwork` in `App.tsx`
- Fix CSS import path and add missing wallet-info layout styles
- Fix confirm overlay display (inline block instead of fixed full-screen modal)
- Add `wrongNetwork` to `WalletStatus` type
- Fix PostCSS config ESM conflict and unblock claim-burn tests
- Resolve multiple wallet state typing and wiring inconsistencies

#### CI
- Resolve all Clippy, Format, and Test CI failures (multiple rounds)
- Bump toolchain to satisfy `darling`/`serde_with` dependency requirements
- Apply `cargo-audit` 0.22.0 migration

### Security
- Document full threat model covering oracle key compromise and admin key loss (#119)
- Add `pause` + `drain` emergency function for critical exploit recovery (#912)
- Add re-initialization guards to both escrow and oracle contracts
- Validate token address in `initialize` to prevent rogue token injection
- Enforce game ID uniqueness to prevent duplicate-match payout exploits
- Add `game_id` cross-match injection guard (`Error::GameIdMismatch`)
- Document integer overflow risk in `submit_result` payout calculation
- Document re-entrancy analysis confirming Soroban execution model prevents re-entrancy

### Changed
- `submit_result` now requires a `game_id` parameter that must match the stored match record
- Oracle contract now emits `("oracle", "init")` event on initialization
- Oracle contract validates `game_id` length (1–64 bytes) on submission
- `cancel_match` with both players deposited requires authorization from both parties
- Replace `panic!` in Oracle `initialize` with proper `Error::AlreadyInitialized`

## [0.1.0] - 2026-04-25

### Added
- Soroban escrow contract with XLM stake support
- Oracle contract for Lichess result verification
- Automatic winner payout and draw refund logic
- Match creation, deposit, cancellation, and completion flows
- Admin pause/unpause and oracle update controls
- Match state machine (`Pending` → `Active` → `Completed`/`Cancelled`)
- Read-only query functions: `get_match`, `is_funded`, `get_escrow_balance`
- Oracle query functions: `get_result`, `has_result`
- Oracle `transfer_admin` for key rotation
- CI workflow via GitHub Actions
- Basic project scaffolding and build scripts
