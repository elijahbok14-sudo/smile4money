# Deployment Guide

This document covers end-to-end deployment of smile4money contracts to Stellar testnet and mainnet.

## Prerequisites

- **Rust toolchain** (1.70+) with `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target:
  ```bash
  rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
  ```
- **Stellar CLI** — install from the [official docs](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/tools/developer-tools/cli/install-cli)
- **Stellar deployer account** funded with XLM (testnet XLM is free via Friendbot; mainnet requires real XLM)
- **`git`** checkout of the repository at the commit to deploy

## Testnet Deployment

### 1. Create and fund a deployer identity

```bash
stellar keys generate deployer --network testnet
```

This creates a local keypair named `deployer` and registers it for the `testnet` network. To view the public address:

```bash
stellar keys address deployer
```

If the account has not been used before, it needs a minimum XLM balance. The deploy script funds it automatically via Friendbot, but you can also fund it manually:

```bash
curl -sf "https://friendbot.stellar.org?addr=$(stellar keys address deployer)"
```

**Expected output:**
```json
{"message": "Account created!", "hash": "..."}
```

### 2. Run the deploy script

```bash
./scripts/deploy_testnet.sh
```

The script performs these steps in order:

1. Verifies the `stellar` CLI is installed and the `deployer` identity exists.
2. Funds the deployer via Friendbot (no-op if already funded).
3. Builds both contracts (`escrow.wasm`, `oracle.wasm`) in release mode.
4. Deploys the escrow contract to testnet.
5. Deploys the oracle contract to testnet.
6. Initializes the oracle contract (admin = deployer address).
7. Initializes the escrow contract (oracle = oracle contract address, admin = deployer address).
8. Writes `CONTRACT_ESCROW` and `CONTRACT_ORACLE` to `.env`.

**Expected output:**
```
Deployer: GABCDEF123...
Funding deployer account via friendbot...
Building contracts...
Deploying escrow contract...
Escrow contract: CC123...
Deploying oracle contract...
Oracle contract: CC456...
Initializing oracle contract...
Initializing escrow contract...

Deployment complete.
  Escrow:  CC123...
  Oracle:  CC456...
Contract IDs written to .env
```

### 3. Verify the deployment

Check that contract IDs were written to `.env`:

```bash
grep -E "^(CONTRACT_ESCROW|CONTRACT_ORACLE)=" .env
```

Verify the contracts are live and responsive:

```bash
# Check escrow contract is queryable (should return match count 0)
stellar contract invoke \
  --id "$(grep CONTRACT_ESCROW .env | cut -d= -f2)" \
  --source deployer \
  --network testnet \
  --rpc-url https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org \
  --network-passphrase "Test SDF Network ; September 2015" \
  -- get_match \
  --match_id 0

# Check oracle contract is queryable
stellar contract invoke \
  --id "$(grep CONTRACT_ORACLE .env | cut -d= -f2)" \
  --source deployer \
  --network testnet \
  --rpc-url https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org \
  --network-passphrase "Test SDF Network ; September 2015" \
  -- has_result \
  --match_id 0
```

If the contracts are deployed correctly, `has_result` returns `false` and `get_match` returns `Error::MatchNotFound` (the contract is live and rejecting invalid queries properly).

### 4. Configure the off-chain oracle

After deployment, populate the remaining `.env` fields:

```env
STELLAR_NETWORK=testnet
STELLAR_RPC_URL=https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org
CONTRACT_ESCROW=<contract-id-from-deploy>
CONTRACT_ORACLE=<contract-id-from-deploy>
LICHESS_API_TOKEN=<your-lichess-api-token>
CHESSDOTCOM_API_KEY=<your-chessdotcom-api-key>
VITE_STELLAR_NETWORK=testnet
VITE_STELLAR_RPC_URL=https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org
```

These values are used by the off-chain oracle service and the frontend.

## Mainnet Deployment

Mainnet deployment follows the same steps but with additional precautions because transactions are irreversible and consume real XLM.

### Pre-deploy review checklist

- [ ] All CI jobs pass on the commit being deployed (test, clippy, fmt, build).
- [ ] Security audit (`cargo audit`) reports zero unresolved advisories.
- [ ] Contracts have been live on testnet for at least one full test cycle.
- [ ] A dedicated deployer key is used — never a personal or shared key.
- [ ] The deployer account is funded with sufficient XLM to cover deploy + init fees (approximately 10–20 XLM).
- [ ] The commit to deploy has been reviewed and approved by at least one other team member.
- [ ] A rollback plan exists (redeploying previous contract IDs).
- [ ] The `.env` file from the previous testnet deploy is backed up separately (not overwritten).

### 1. Create a mainnet deployer identity

```bash
stellar keys generate deployer --network mainnet
```

### 2. Fund the deployer account

Send real XLM to the deployer address:

```bash
stellar keys address deployer
# Send XLM to the output address from a funded Stellar account or exchange
```

The account needs enough for:
- Escrow contract deploy fee
- Oracle contract deploy fee
- Two initialization invocations
- Minimum account balance (~1 XLM)

10–20 XLM is a comfortable buffer.

### 3. Run the deploy script

```bash
./scripts/deploy_mainnet.sh
```

The script is identical to the testnet version except:
- Targets `mainnet` network and RPC endpoints.
- Does **not** call Friendbot (no Friendbot exists for mainnet).
- Prompts for confirmation before proceeding.
- Updates all `STELLAR_NETWORK` and `VITE_STELLAR_NETWORK` fields in `.env` to `mainnet`.

**Expected output:**
```
Deployer: GXYZ...
Network:  mainnet (PUBLIC — real XLM will be spent)

Continue with mainnet deployment? [y/N] y
Building contracts...
Deploying escrow contract...
Escrow contract: CC789...
Deploying oracle contract...
Oracle contract: CC012...
Initializing oracle contract...
Initializing escrow contract...

Mainnet deployment complete.
  Escrow:  CC789...
  Oracle:  CC012...
Contract IDs written to .env
```

### 4. Post-deploy verification

Run the same verification as testnet (step 3 above), but use mainnet RPC and passphrase:

```bash
MAINNET_RPC="https://soroban-mainnet.stellar.org"
MAINNET_PASSPHRASE="Public Global Stellar Network ; September 2015"

stellar contract invoke \
  --id "$CONTRACT_ESCROW" \
  --source deployer \
  --network mainnet \
  --rpc-url "$MAINNET_RPC" \
  --network-passphrase "$MAINNET_PASSPHRASE" \
  -- get_match \
  --match_id 0

stellar contract invoke \
  --id "$CONTRACT_ORACLE" \
  --source deployer \
  --network mainnet \
  --rpc-url "$MAINNET_RPC" \
  --network-passphrase "$MAINNET_PASSPHRASE" \
  -- has_result \
  --match_id 0
```

Additionally:

- [ ] Record contract IDs in a secure, durable location (e.g., a password manager, team wiki, or a GitHub release).
- [ ] Verify the admin and oracle addresses stored on-chain are correct with `stellar contract inspect`.
- [ ] Run a smoke test: create a test match, deposit stake, and cancel it to verify the full flow.
- [ ] Update the frontend configuration with the new mainnet contract IDs and network.

## Troubleshooting

### `stellar: command not found`

The Stellar CLI is not installed or not in `PATH`.

**Fix:** Install from https://developers.stellar.org/docs/tools/developer-tools/cli/install-cli

### `identity 'deployer' not found`

The deployer keypair has not been created yet.

**Fix:**
```bash
stellar keys generate deployer --network testnet
```

### `Account does not exist` or `insufficient funds`

The deployer account has no XLM balance.

**Fix (testnet):** The deploy script funds via Friendbot automatically. If it fails, run manually:
```bash
curl -sf "https://friendbot.stellar.org?addr=$(stellar keys address deployer)"
```

**Fix (mainnet):** Send real XLM to the deployer address from a funded account.

### `wasm file not found after build`

The WASM build failed or produced output in an unexpected location.

**Fix:** Run the build separately to see errors:
```bash
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release
```
Common causes:
- Missing `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target: `rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown`
- Rust toolchain too old: `rustup update`
- Compilation errors in contract code

### `Invoke failed: Error::AlreadyInitialized`

One of the contracts was already initialized. This happens if the deploy script was run twice without deploying new contracts.

**Fix:** Deploy fresh contracts (the script deploys new instances each run). If you want to re-use existing contracts, skip initialization and just update `.env` with the existing IDs.

### `Invoke failed: error decoding response: ...`

The contract invocation succeeded but the response format was unexpected. This usually means the contract is live and responding — check that the function name and arguments match the contract interface.

**Fix:** Verify you are using the correct function name and parameter types. See `docs/api-reference.md` for the full contract API.

### Timeout during deploy or invoke

Network congestion or RPC endpoint issues.

**Fix:** Retry the command. If the problem persists, verify the RPC endpoint is healthy:
```bash
curl -s <rpc-url> | head -20
```
You can also increase timeouts with the `--timeout` flag on `stellar` commands.
