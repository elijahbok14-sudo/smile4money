# Threat Model & Security

## System Actors and Trust Boundaries

| Actor | Role | Trust Boundary |
|-------|------|----------------|
| **Player 1 / Player 2** | Create matches, deposit stakes, cancel matches | Authenticated by Stellar keypair. Trusted for own key management. Not trusted to act honestly toward each other. |
| **Oracle** | Submits verified game results from Lichess/Chess.com | Authenticated by oracle keypair. Trusted for accurate result reporting. Not trusted with custody of funds. |
| **Admin** | Pause/unpause contract, rotate oracle address | Authenticated by admin keypair. Trusted for emergency operations. Not trusted to access escrowed funds. |
| **Lichess / Chess.com API** | External source of truth for game outcomes | Outside the Soroban runtime boundary. Trusted to return correct results (within the oracle's verification logic). |
| **Stellar / Soroban runtime** | Executes contract code, enforces authorization | Fully trusted for correct execution, state isolation, and ledger security. |

### Trust Boundary Diagram

```
  [Player 1] ──auth──┐
                      ├──► [Escrow Contract] ◄── [Oracle] ◄── [Lichess API]
  [Player 2] ──auth──┘                              │             └── [Chess.com API]
                                                    │
                                              [Admin key]
```

- **Boundary A** (Player → Contract): Authentication via `require_auth()`. Players cannot impersonate each other.
- **Boundary B** (Oracle → Contract): Authentication via stored oracle address. Only the registered oracle may submit results.
- **Boundary C** (Admin → Contract): Authentication via stored admin address. Admin controls emergency functions only.
- **Boundary D** (External API → Oracle): Off-chain. Oracle is trusted to verify API responses before submitting on-chain.

## STRIDE Threat Model

### Spoofing

| Threat | Target | Risk | Mitigation |
|--------|--------|------|------------|
| Attacker impersonates a player to deposit or cancel | `deposit`, `cancel_match` | Medium | `player.require_auth()` enforces Stellar signature verification |
| Attacker impersonates the oracle to submit fraudulent results | `submit_result` | **High** | Oracle address stored in contract; `caller.require_auth()` + comparison against stored address |
| Attacker impersonates the admin to pause or rotate oracle | `pause`, `unpause`, `update_oracle` | Medium | `admin.require_auth()` enforced on each admin function |

### Tampering

| Threat | Target | Risk | Mitigation |
|--------|--------|------|------------|
| Oracle submits result for wrong match_id | `submit_result` | Medium | `game_id` parameter cross-checked against stored `game_id` in match record |
| Oracle submits duplicate result to double-payout | `submit_result` | **High** | State machine rejects `submit_result` when `state != Active`; `Completed` is terminal |
| Attacker creates multiple matches with same game_id | `create_match` | Medium | `DataKey::GameId` tracked; duplicate game_id returns `DuplicateGameId` error |
| Admin drains funds without pause precondition | `emergency_drain` | Medium | `NotPaused` error if contract is not paused; event emitted for transparency |

### Repudiation

| Threat | Target | Risk | Mitigation |
|--------|--------|------|------------|
| Player denies having deposited | `deposit` | Low | On-chain events (`match:deposit`) record player address, match_id, and amount |
| Oracle denies having submitted a result | `submit_result` | Low | On-chain events (`match:completed`) record winner, match_id, and payout amount |
| Admin denies having paused or drained | `pause`, `emergency_drain` | Low | On-chain events (`admin:paused`, `admin:drain`) record the action |

### Information Disclosure

| Threat | Target | Risk | Mitigation |
|--------|--------|------|------------|
| Attacker reads all match data including player addresses | `get_match`, `is_funded`, `get_escrow_balance` | Low | All match state is public by design on Stellar; no confidential data is stored |

### Denial of Service

| Threat | Target | Risk | Mitigation |
|--------|--------|------|------------|
| Attacker creates many matches to fill storage | `create_match` | Low | Each match requires player1 auth; cost of storage is a deterrent; no DoS vector identified |
| Attacker front-runs match creation with duplicate game_id | `create_match` | Low | The legitimate creator can choose a unique or unpredictably long game_id string |
| Oracle never submits a result, locking funds in Active state | `submit_result` | Medium | Players can cancel only while Pending, not Active. **Known limitation**: no auto-timeout exists; a future enhancement should add a timeout-based cancellation. |
| Admin never unpauses after emergency | `unpause` | Low | Admin is a trusted party; governance processes should handle key loss scenarios |

### Elevation of Privilege

| Threat | Target | Risk | Mitigation |
|--------|--------|------|------------|
| Non-oracle address calls submit_result | `submit_result` | **High** | Caller verified against stored oracle address before any state change |
| Non-admin calls pause/unpause/drain | `pause`, `unpause`, `emergency_drain` | **High** | Admin address verified via `require_auth()` |
| Non-player deposits into or cancels a match | `deposit`, `cancel_match` | Medium | `player == m.player1 \|\| player == m.player2` enforced |

---

## Trust Assumptions

| Actor | Trusted for | Not trusted for |
|-------|-------------|-----------------|
| Stellar network | Correct execution of Soroban contracts | — |
| Oracle service | Accurate game result reporting | Custody of player funds |
| Admin key | Pause/unpause, oracle rotation | Accessing escrowed funds |
| Players | Their own key management | Each other |

No single party can unilaterally steal funds. The escrow contract enforces all payout rules on-chain.

## Detailed Risk Analysis

### Oracle Key Compromise

| Attribute | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| **Impact** | **Critical**. An attacker with the oracle key can call `submit_result` on any Active match, directing the entire pot to any winner (including Player1 or Player2 arbitrarily). The contract has no on-chain mechanism to distinguish a legitimate oracle submission from a compromised one. |
| **Likelihood** | **Low to Medium**. The oracle key is held by a centralized service. The risk depends on the security posture of the oracle infrastructure (HSM, key rotation, access controls). |
| **Mitigations** | |
| | 1. **Key rotation**: Admin can call `update_oracle()` to replace the compromised key with a new one. This does not revert past submissions but prevents further damage. |
| | 2. **Separation of duties**: Oracle key and admin key are separate. A single compromise cannot both submit results and rotate the oracle key. |
| | 3. **Event monitoring**: Every `submit_result` emits a `match:completed` event. Monitoring infrastructure can detect anomalous submissions. |
| | 4. **Future enhancement**: Multi-sig oracle (M-of-N) so a single key compromise does not permit result submission. |
| **Recovery** | 1. Admin calls `pause()` to block all state-changing operations. 2. Admin calls `update_oracle()` with a new, uncompromised key. 3. For disputed matches, the admin can use `emergency_drain()` (requires pause) to move funds to a safe address pending dispute resolution off-chain. 4. Unpause once the new oracle is operational. |

### Admin Key Loss

| Attribute | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| **Impact** | **High**. A lost admin key permanently prevents `pause()`, `unpause()`, `update_oracle()`, and `emergency_drain()`. If the oracle key is also compromised, there is no way to stop the contract. If the oracle is functioning, the contract continues to operate normally. |
| **Likelihood** | **Low**. Admin key should be stored securely (hardware wallet, multi-sig, cold storage). |
| **Mitigations** | |
| | 1. **Multi-sig**: The admin address SHOULD be a multi-sig contract (e.g., Stellar clawback or Soroban multi-sig) requiring M-of-N signatures. |
| | 2. **Backup keys**: At minimum, a backup admin key should be held by a separate trusted party. |
| | 3. **Timelock**: A future enhancement should add a timelock between `pause()` and `emergency_drain()`, giving players time to react. |
| **Recovery** | | |
| | 1. If the contract has been initialized with a multi-sig admin, the admin role can be recovered through the multi-sig's governance process. |
| | 2. **No on-chain recovery exists for a single-key admin**. The contract would need to be re-deployed and all active matches migrated off-chain. |
| | 3. **Future enhancement**: A social recovery mechanism (e.g., N-of-M guardian accounts) could restore admin privileges. |

### Lichess / Chess.com API Manipulation

| Attribute | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| **Impact** | **High**. If the chess platform returns fraudulent results (or the oracle does not verify API responses correctly), incorrect payouts are executed. The contract trusts the oracle to verify API responses. |
| **Likelihood** | **Low**. Both Lichess and Chess.com have established reputations; API responses are signed or served over TLS. The oracle should additionally verify the response against a secondary source or require cryptographic proof. |
| **Mitigations** | |
| | 1. **Oracle verification**: The oracle service must independently verify the API response (e.g., check multiple endpoints, validate TLS certificates, cross-reference game state). |
| | 2. **Game ID binding**: The `game_id` stored in the match record must match the `game_id` submitted by the oracle. This prevents the oracle from reusing a legitimate result from one match in another. |
| | 3. **Event monitoring**: All result submissions emit events; anomalous results can be detected off-chain. |
| | 4. **Dispute window**: A future enhancement should add a challenge period during which players can dispute a result with proof. |
| **Recovery** | 1. Admin pauses the contract. 2. Admin investigates the fraudulent submissions off-chain. 3. If funds remain in the contract, `emergency_drain()` can recover them. 4. For funds already paid out, legal recourse or social consensus is required. |

### Front-Running Attacks

| Threat | Description | Risk | Mitigation |
|--------|-------------|------|------------|
| **Deposit front-running** | An attacker observes a `create_match` transaction and submits a `deposit` before the intended player. | Low | `deposit` checks that the caller is `player1` or `player2` from the match record. The attacker's address would not match either player. |
| **Cancel front-running** | An attacker observes a `deposit` and front-runs with `cancel_match` to lock the deposit. | Low | `cancel_match` also requires the caller to be a player. Additionally, once both players have deposited (state = Active), `cancel_match` is rejected. |
| **Oracle result front-running** | An attacker observes a pending oracle submission and submits their own result first. | Low | Only the registered oracle address can submit results. The attacker cannot spoof the oracle identity. |

---

## Threat Model & Mitigations (per-function)

### Re-initialization Attack

**Threat**: An attacker calls `initialize` a second time to overwrite the oracle or admin address.

**Mitigation**: Both contracts check `env.storage().instance().has(&DataKey::Oracle/Admin)` before writing. A second call panics immediately.

### Malicious Oracle Substitution

**Threat**: An attacker replaces the oracle address to redirect payouts.

**Mitigation**: The oracle address is set at initialization and can only be rotated by the admin via `update_oracle`. The admin key is separate from the oracle key.

### Unauthorized Result Submission

**Threat**: A non-oracle address calls `submit_result` on the escrow contract.

**Mitigation**: `submit_result` compares `caller` against the stored `DataKey::Oracle` address and returns `Error::Unauthorized` on mismatch, before any state change.

### Double Result Submission

**Threat**: The oracle submits a result twice, potentially changing the winner.

**Mitigation**: The escrow contract checks `m.state == Active` before processing. Once set to `Completed`, any further `submit_result` call returns `Error::InvalidState`. The oracle contract additionally rejects duplicate submissions with `Error::AlreadySubmitted`.

### Cross-Match Result Injection (GameIdMismatch)

**Threat**: A compromised oracle submits a result for the correct `match_id` but with a `game_id` belonging to a different game, redirecting a payout to the wrong winner.

**Mitigation**: `submit_result` on the escrow contract requires a `game_id` parameter and compares it against the `game_id` stored in the match record at creation time. A mismatch returns `Error::GameIdMismatch` before any state change or token transfer occurs.

### Duplicate Game ID Exploit (DuplicateGameId)

**Threat**: An attacker creates multiple matches referencing the same chess `game_id`. If the oracle submits a result for that game, all duplicate matches could be paid out, draining the contract.

**Mitigation**: `create_match` tracks every accepted `game_id` in persistent storage under `DataKey::GameId(game_id)`. A second `create_match` call with the same `game_id` returns `Error::DuplicateGameId` immediately, before any match record is written.

### Deposit into Inactive Match

**Threat**: A player deposits into a cancelled or completed match, locking funds.

**Mitigation**: `deposit` checks `m.state == Pending` and returns `Error::InvalidState` for any other state.

### Zero-Stake Match

**Threat**: A match is created with `stake_amount = 0`, wasting ledger storage.

**Mitigation**: `create_match` returns `Error::InvalidAmount` if `stake_amount <= 0`.

### Self-Match

**Threat**: A single address creates a match against itself to manipulate state or waste resources.

**Mitigation**: `create_match` checks `player1 != player2` and returns `Error::InvalidPlayers` on violation.

### Storage Expiry

**Threat**: A persistent `Match` entry expires mid-game, causing `MatchNotFound` errors.

**Mitigation**: Every persistent write calls `extend_ttl` with `MATCH_TTL_LEDGERS` (518,400 ledgers, ~30 days). TTL is refreshed on deposit, result submission, and cancellation.

### Contract Vulnerability Response

**Threat**: A critical bug is discovered post-deployment with no way to stop ongoing damage.

**Mitigation**: The admin can call `pause()` to block `create_match`, `deposit`, and `submit_result`. Existing matches can still be cancelled to recover funds. `unpause()` restores normal operation.

### Integer Overflow in Match Counter

**Threat**: `MatchCount` wraps silently in release mode, reusing match IDs.

**Mitigation**: `create_match` uses `id.checked_add(1).ok_or(Error::Overflow)?`.

### Insufficient Token Allowance

**Threat**: `deposit` is called without the player first approving sufficient token allowance for the escrow contract, resulting in a generic transfer failure.

**Mitigation**: Before calling `try_transfer`, `deposit` checks `token.allowance(player, env.current_contract_address()) >= stake_amount` and returns `Error::InsufficientAllowance` with a clear message if not met. See `contracts/escrow/src/lib.rs`.

### Re-entrancy

**Threat**: A malicious token contract could re-enter the escrow contract during the `try_transfer` or `transfer` call, modifying state in unexpected ways.

**Mitigation**: Soroban's execution model prevents re-entrancy — the runtime does not allow a contract to be re-entered while it is already executing. All state changes in `deposit` occur after the external call (checks-effects-interactions pattern is followed for token transfers). See `// SAFETY: no re-entrancy risk because...` comments in `contracts/escrow/src/lib.rs` and the re-entrancy tests in `contracts/escrow/src/tests.rs`.

### Out-of-Range Match ID

**Threat**: Functions accepting a `match_id` may receive an out-of-range value (e.g., `u64::MAX`), causing a storage read miss that returns `MatchNotFound` rather than a more descriptive error.

**Mitigation**: All functions accepting `match_id` validate `match_id < get_match_count()` up front and return `Error::MatchNotFound` for invalid IDs, providing a consistent and predictable error path. See `contracts/escrow/src/lib.rs`.

## Known Limitations

- The oracle service is a centralised component. A compromised oracle key can submit incorrect results. Key rotation via `update_oracle` mitigates this without redeployment.
- There is no timeout mechanism to auto-cancel a match if the oracle never submits a result. Players must manually cancel a pending match to recover funds. For matches in `Active` state (both players deposited), no on-chain cancellation is possible — the oracle must submit a result.
- The admin `pause` function does not block `cancel_match`, so players can always recover deposits even when the contract is paused.
- There is no on-chain recovery for a lost single-key admin. Multi-sig admin is strongly recommended for production deployments.
- There is no challenge/dispute period for oracle-submitted results. Players must trust the oracle's correctness off-chain.

## Future Security Enhancements

- **Multi-sig oracle**: Require M-of-N oracle signatures to submit a result, preventing single-key compromise from authorizing fraudulent payouts.
- **Timelocked emergency drain**: Add a delay between `pause()` and `emergency_drain()` so players can monitor and react.
- **Result dispute window**: Allow players to challenge a result within a defined window by providing cryptographic proof.
- **Admin social recovery**: N-of-M guardian accounts could restore admin access in case of key loss.
- **Auto-cancel timeout**: Automatically cancel matches that remain in `Active` beyond a reasonable ledger count.
